TIME DOMAIN:

There are 3 types of measurements that can be made in Time Domain using the PS9201A or "Picoscope":
1. Single Acquistion
2. Real Time Acquisition
3. Full Array Acquisition

1. Single Acquisition

Features:
- Can acquired and save multiple signals to text file
- Can be Averaged / Filtered / Processed
- Can store / plot acquired signal to graph

In order to save signal to text file...
check off the signal(s) you'd like to save in the Averaging box.
e.g. PicoScope Averaging, Software Averaging, or Single Acquisition
The program will then save in the format displayed in the "File name format" textbox.
The default format is "sig_%TX%_%RX%.txt".
The program will automatically replace %TX% and %RX% with the appropriate antenna values if known.
NOTE: to set the antenna values, turn on the Switching Matrix and set antennae values.

In order to plot...
First, plotting requires storing the signal values to the global array. This means that the Switching Matrix must be turned on and the RX / TX antennae set to known values.
Then, select the signal to be displayed from the "Analysis" groupbox and set # of averaging samples (if needed).
NOTE: Saving to text file / checking values in the "Averaging" groupbox isn't necessary for plotting.
